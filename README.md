# movie-trailer-website
<p>This is a project created in python for the Udacity full-stack nanodegree program. This goal of this project is to display a static webpage of all my favorite movies. Each of the movies are linked directly to their trailer on YouTube.</p>

<h2>What's included:</h2>
<ul>
<li>media.py - media() class stores the movie title, story line, poster image, and youtube URL for each movie passed in from entertainment_center.py 
</li>
<li>entertainment_center.py - Creates the list of movies that are passed to media.py and calls fresh_tomatoes.py to generate the web page.</li>
<li>fresh_tomatoes.py - includes the HTML needed for the website</li>
<li>fresh_tomatoes.html</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps required to successfully run the application:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install python</li>
<li>Download the included files in my movie-trailer-website repository</li>
<li>Open the files in IDLE</li>
<li>Run the program using entertainment_center.py</li>

</ol>
