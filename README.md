# movie-trailer-website
<p>This is a project created in python for the Udacity full-stack nanodegree program. This goal of this project is to display a static webpage of all my favorite movies. Each of the movies are linked directly to their trailer on YouTube.</p>
<p>To view my project, download the files contained in this repository.</p>
